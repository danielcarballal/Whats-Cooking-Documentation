## Introduction to What’s Cooking 
Have you ever been to a restaurant that was highly recommended by a friend or a website, only to discover that you have no idea what to order? That is our motivation: to provide a simple and intuitive website that allows users to see what others thought was delicious and gives recommendations on what to eat.
Ratings for items at restaurants do not exist on any well known applications. Individual restaurants have ratings on a number of popular applications, such as Yelp, but our website solves the problem “What do you order when you get to a restaurant?”. Users can choose restaurants, but may be indecisive about what food they might want to eat. By highlighting features and palettes of the platters, such as spicy or sweet, users can make more informed decisions about what food to order. We can also recommend specific dishes to them based on what we know about their preferences and dish reviews from other users. On our website, users can search for restaurants, view the items that have been rated so far, and contribute.
